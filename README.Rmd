## Motivation
The motivation for `qalyr` was to standardised the way that health state utility values were prepared for input to our decision-analytic models. Health state utility values associated with tobacco- and alcohol-related disease diagnosis codes are derived from the HODaR data [@currie2005routine], and general population utility values from the Health Survey for England [@Ara2010]. The suite of functions within `qalyr` wrangle the data into the correct format and then calculate the health state utility values. To do so, we use the `eq5d` R package [@eq5dpackage].         

`qalyr` was created as part of a programme of work on the health economics of tobacco and alcohol at the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), The University of Sheffield. This programme is based around the construction of the Sheffield Tobacco and Alcohol Policy Model (STAPM), which aims to use comparable methodologies to evaluate the impacts of tobacco and alcohol policies, and investigate the consequences of clustering and interactions between tobacco and alcohol consumption behaviours.   

## Installation
`qalyr` is currently available only to members of the project team (but please contact Duncan Gillespie duncan.gillespie@sheffield.ac.uk to discuss). To access you need to [*sign-up for a GitLab account*](https://gitlab.com/). You will then need to be added to the STAPM project team to gain access.   

Once that is sorted, you can install the latest version or a specified version of `qalyr` from GitLab with:     

```{r gh_installation, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("devtools")
#install.packages("getPass")

devtools::install_git(
  "https://gitlab.com/stapm/r-packages/qalyr.git", 
  credentials = git2r::cred_user_pass("uname", getPass::getPass()),
  ref = "x.x.x",
  build_vignettes = TRUE
)

# Where uname is your Gitlab user name.
# ref = "x.x.x" is the version to install - remove this to install the latest version
# this should make a box pop up where you enter your GitLab password
```

Then load the package, and some other packages that are useful. Note that the code within `qalyr` uses the `data.table::data.table()` syntax.  

```{r pkgs, eval = F}
# Load the package
library(qalyr)
library(eq5d)

# Other useful packages
library(dplyr) # for data manipulation and summary
library(magrittr) # for pipes
library(ggplot2) # for plotting
```

## Citation
